# Task

I tried to use the streaming library from PedroSG94 (https://github.com/pedroSG94), but I ran into an issue. I've never worked on a streaming task like this before, and the problem I faced is that the library's documentation was recently updated, and everything has changed. Because of the tight deadline, I am submitting the project as-is.
